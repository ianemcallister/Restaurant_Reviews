# Project 3: Restaurant Reviews

This is the third project as part of the Udacity Senior Web Developer Nano Degree.

This is restaurant reviews application that collects reviews from users and provides them alongside basic information about each restaurant (restaurant names, a photograph, address and operating hours).

**Accessible:** The focus of this project is to ensure that this site is current with web accissiblity standards.  This site demonstrates accessiblity across several areas.

## Features
**Accesibility Features**

1. **Images**
	All content-related images include appropriate alternate text.

2. **Focus**
